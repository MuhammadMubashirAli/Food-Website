            <p class="mt-4 ">Pizza (English: /ˈpɪtzə/ PIT-zə, Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin
                consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and
                often various other ingredients (such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives,
                vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
                oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

                In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and
                fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

                The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian
                town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the
                dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most
                popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia;
                available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine,
                via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be
                frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven</p>
